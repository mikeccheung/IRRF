iRobot Recipe Finder

Input ingredients you have in your fridge, seperated by commas, and the Recipe Finder will find a recipe where you are missing the fewest ingredients!
If you accept the recipe, it will add the recipe to your Recipe List and the missing ingredients to your Shopping List.
If you reject the recipe, the Recipe Finder will look for another recipe for you.
Once you are done adding recipes to your list, the Recipe Finder will print out your Recipe List and Shopping List.
